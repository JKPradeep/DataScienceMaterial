Transition towards DataScience

**************Step By Step Action Plan For Learning Data Science*****************

1. Programming Language : *Python / R - (Java, Scala, Julia) - Reason: Huge Inbuilt libraries
* Python  : 
IDE - 
1. PyCharm
2. Jupyter*
3. Spyder

Basic Syntax :  variables, string, lists, tuples, dictionaries
Functions
Oops concept
Exception Handling
Libary: Numpy (to create arrays)- import, basic operations on arrays (Indexing,reshaping, broadcasting)
--------------------
* Data Preprocessing
Library: Pandas (Data preprocessing) - DataSeries, DataFrames Operations -  Convert into array - Given to ML Machine Learning model to train the Data, 
Handling Missing Data
Scaling Data - normal distribution, Std ND
Library: scikit - All kind of ML algorithms - Superwise and Unsuperwise algorithms - 
Seaborn: Python data visualization library based on matplotlib (correlation, pieplot, count plot, histogram, probabilty density functions..)
--------------------
2. Visualization Tools:  Reporting Tools to publish report
PowerBI*
Tableau
Qlik Sense*
MATPLOTLIB, SEABORN in python
--------------------
3. Mathematics
Statistics  - mean, median, mode, normal distribution, std ND, chernobyl inequality statistics, central limit theorem, IQR range, percentile, correlation, covariance, subNormalDistribution,std deviation, skew -  Useful for substituting missing value 
Differential Equations
Linear Algebra 
statistics 
Differential Calculus 
Discrete Maths 
Numerical Analysis  
Matrices
Scalars & Vectors
Probabilty
------youtube - khanAcademy-----------
********Processed Data Out for Algorithms******** 
--------------------

4. Exploratory Data Analysis EDA
*Consider a Dataset -  Analyise What are Continuous & Discrete variables, Categorical variables,  
*For Suppose Data in form of Normal Distribution - How to scale down data -  2 ways - i. min max  scalar 	ii. log normal scaling technique iii. std scalar
*Scaler library - 
--------------------
5. DataStructures and Algorithm -  Use for writing Efficient Code
To store data, values
DataFrames, Tuples, Lists...
Sorting Algorithm
How fast our program runs
--------------------
6. Machine Learning
Classification
Regression
Reinforcement
Deep Learning
Dimensionality Red
Clustering

* Algorithms -  15 to 20 compulsory - 
Linear Regression alg
lasso regression alg
ridge regression alg
logistic regression alg and classifier
decision tree alg
random forest regression and classifier
adaboost regression and classifier
xgboost regression and classifier.............

* Hyper Parameter tuning for above algorithms  : Understand Maths - GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV difference. 

* Knowledge on pipeline mechanism -  Step by step implementation 
Step1 : Doing Scaling Mechanism
Step2 : Doing principle component analysis on dimensional reduction
Step3 : Applying Algorithms

*********Machine Learning Model Created********
--------------------
7. Deployment
*******We go for Deployment******
Deployment in Azure
Deployment in Heroku -  Platform as a service - Preferable -  Free of Cost
Deployment in aws ec2 -  Infrastructure as a service
Deployment in google cloud

* Deveops - *dockers and kubernetes - How to deploy code in a much efficient and scalable way
--------------------
8. Deep Learning
Algorithms
artificial Neural Network - ANN - 
convolutional Neural Network - CNN - Image processing and classification 
recurrent Neural Network - RNN - Time series data

All new algorithms are derived from above 3 algorithms only
Advanced Convolutional Neural Networks like vgg16 neural network, resnet- 50 neural network
Master Region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN), YONO cnn neural network, object detection

Deployment: 
Same as ML

Libraries: 
Keras  : Wrapper on Tensor Flow
Tensor Flow* : 
pytorch*

fast.ai - fast.ai is a non-profit research group focused on deep learning and artificial intelligence.
		- free open source library for deep learning called fastai (without a period), sitting atop PyTorch
--------------------
9. Framework : Flask, Django
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

Model that is deployed in production is exposed as API to FrontEnd User
Create API
--------------------
10. Databases
SQL : Structured data : Merge data from Tables
Mongo Db (No sequel database) : Semi structured data(JSON) &&  Unstructured data(Image) - Install pymongo 
BigData (hadoop) - hadoop cassandra -  PEG, Hive, Flume are bigdata Architecture - All type of data (Structured and Unstructured data also)
django database (AWS)

* Cloud Computing Services - AWS, Azure, cloud foundry
***Train Live data continuously 
--------------------
11. Natural Language Processing (NLP)- Deals with Text Data
Chatbot
eg: Political Sentiment Analysis, When Stock Market collapse
Chatbot Tool-  AI tool to Quickly train the data
--------------------
12. GIT repository
Create branch,  Merge branch, Master branch....
--------------------
13. Excel 
--------------------
